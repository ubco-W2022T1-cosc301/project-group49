## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We would like to find out if there are patterns in the data with respect to different variables such as:
-Whether 'home team' advantage is reflected on who wins the game.
-If the half time score affects the final score
-The winning patterns of teams carried to the next world cup
-How the crowd attendance affects the number of goals scored in the game
-If certain stadiums has more goals scored.
Since the worldcup is such a celebrated event, we thought it would be fun to find out if we could anaylse patterns to find out if we can make predictions of future games.
We could see this being turned into a data dashboard for easy interpretation.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

A Data Scientist, Andre Becklas from Brazil compiled the data from the Fifa World Cup Archive website and posted it on kaggle.com for the public to use. Our dataset includes information on each match played in the World Cup since it began. It includes information such as which stage was match in, the stadium, half-time score, referee and much more! Our dataset covers the time period: 1930 - 2014. The purpose of the dataset is public interest, availability and learning. With this quantity, quality and density of data, there is good scope for analysis. We speculate that there is some correlation between the home team and the winner of the match. We also think that the winning patterns of a team in a world cup X will have some correlation with how they play in the next world cup. We will also be exploring if the attendance affects the match in any way - number of goals, home/away team performance, etc.
