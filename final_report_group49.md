# Final Report Group 49

## Introduction
Our group explored a Fifa world cup dataset that included information on all games played until the 2014 tournament. When we began the project, the 2022 World Cup was still 2 months away and as we are about to submit our findings, the World Cup is currently happening! It was rewarding to see the data we analyzed come to life, and having a better understanding of the game backed by data.
